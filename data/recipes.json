		"method": "In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the coconut milk, red curry paste, fish sauce, brown sugar, lime juice, and vegetable oil. Add the chicken strips to the bowl and toss until well coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours. When ready to cook, preheat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Thread the chicken strips onto the bamboo skewers. Grill the chicken skewers for 2-3 minutes per side, or until cooked through and lightly charred. Serve hot with peanut sauce and cucumber salad, if desired."
